MySquirrel : Protect PHP and MySQL against injection attacks!
=============================================================

MySquirrel is a lightweight object-oriented wrapper around the MySQL and MySQLi
extensions of PHP 5. The focus is on simplicity and ease of use, robust error
handling, and most of all, security. MySquirrel makes it super easy to run
parametrized queries and prepared statements, while requiring nothing more than
good old mysql_* functions. (If MySQLi is available, MySquirrel will prefer it.)
